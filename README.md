homework 04

https://sanawck.github.io/code-quiz/.

this assignement was to create a code quiz with multiple choice answers displaying right or wrong answers. I found this to be challenging and difficult and had to reference multiple reading material and videos to accomplish even this much. I was not able to successfully store the Initials or high scores. I plan to learn more and go in and fix the elements in the future.
